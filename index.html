                    Did you missed me?<br> So.. how i have missed you,but <br> i knew that we would back together some day.
                    <br> I saw in my dreams, welcome to my thoughts: <br> My name is Celeste <br> We're gonna have so much fun here. <br> This is my special place and all my dear friends can feel safe here.
                    <br>
                    <br> In the past, I was a very bad girl.<br> But trust me
                    <br> I have been barbarically punished for all my wrong doings.<br> And that part of me is dead now. <br> However, I keep a reminder so that not even in my weakest moment will I ever turn into that pathetic slob loser ever again. <br><br>That's
                    all in the past. <br> <br> Besides, I'm really sorry for what I did. I mean, all of you forgive me, right? <br> <br> <br> Now, I believe in change. We all change, but don't try to benefit from this. <br> Be careful, because "She" will
                    be waiting, as she doesn't forget. <br> She hates false prophets who proclaim peace and love only to later denigrate their family or friends for their own benefit... <br> to me too... It's disgusting, <br> but is it our responsibility?
                    <br> Are we the voice of reckoning? <br> Will we set them free? <br> Are we special?.<br> <br><br> Author:Lala <br> Creation date:12-07-2024 <br>THANKS FOR READ! ❤️
